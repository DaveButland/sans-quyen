									I always try to make every shoot an enjoyable and productive experience.

									The <strong>UV Beauty Portfolio Builder</strong> events have been so popular at the studio 
									in Plymouth that <a href="https://www.chrisconwayphotography.co.uk/" target="_blank">Chris Conway's</a> has
									decided to take these to other areas around the country as part of his tours! 
									This time it will be <i>Aura Studio</i> in <i>Newmarket</i>.
								</p>
								<p>
									This event is dedicated to creative beauty photography with UV reactive make-up in the mix, 
									and will run from <strong>2pm till 6pm</strong> on <strong>Sunday January 26th</strong> - open to just 6 photographers.
								</p>
								<p>
									The models for the day will be the lovely <a href="http://amieboulton.com/" target="_blank">Amie Boulton</a> and myself. 
									There will be a variety of unique looks created on each model, 
									and with variations in lighting you will leave with <strong>several different sets of images</strong> including a duo set!
								</p>
								<p>
									Chris will be hosting the portfolio builder and will produce all of the lighting set-ups and UV looks for you, 
									utilising a variety of application techniques including: airbrushing, splatter and coarse brush strokes to give lots of texture! 
									The UV light itself will be mixed in with other light sources in the studio so that it's an addition to already great photos 
									- rather than the sole focus.
								</p>
